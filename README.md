# Optical Illusions

I created well-known optical illusions using processing:

* Ebbinghaus Illusion
    - Author: Hermann Ebbinghaus, 1890
    - Tags: Ebbinghaus Illusion, Titchener illusion
* Dynamic Ebbinghaus Illusion
    - Author: Christopher D. Blair, Gideon P. Caplovitz and Ryan E.B. Mruczek, 2014

You can "turn off" the illusions by clicking on them.
